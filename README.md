# Neural Cellular Automata
Basically, cellular automata meeting CNNs allow for automata to follow an "attracting" state through a reconstruction loss. The different training schemes give the cells different behaviors, but the "regenerate" task is the most powerfulâ€”allowing for the cells to rebuild upon damage.
